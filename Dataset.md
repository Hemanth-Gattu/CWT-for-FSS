# PFENet
This is the implementation of our paper [**PFENet: Prior Guided Feature Enrichment Network for Few-shot Segmentation**](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01449) that has been accepted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI). 

# Get Started

### Environment
+ torch==1.4.0 (torch version >= 1.0.1.post2 should be okay to run this repo)
+ numpy==1.18.4
+ tensorboardX==1.8
+ cv2==4.2.0


### Datasets and Data Preparation

Please download the following datasets:

+ PASCAL-5i is based on the [**PASCAL VOC 2012**](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/) and [**SBD**](http://home.bharathh.info/pubs/codes/SBD/download.html) where the val images should be excluded from the list of training samples.

+ [**COCO 2014**](https://cocodataset.org/#download).

This code reads data from .txt files where each line contains the paths for image and the correcponding label respectively. Image and label paths are seperated by a space. Example is as follows:

    image_path_1 label_path_1
    image_path_2 label_path_2
    image_path_3 label_path_3
    ...
    image_path_n label_path_n

Then update the train/val/test list paths in the config files.

After processing, please change the "data_root" and "train/val_list" in config files accordingly.
